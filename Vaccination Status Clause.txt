As discussed during the recruitment process, we consider it is the professional responsibility of all of our staff to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to safeguard both our employees and Service Users. Your employment is therefore conditional on your agreement to be vaccinated against COVID-19. This may include the need for repeat vaccinations as recommended by the UK Government. Any failure to comply with this requirement will be fully investigated and any reasons given as to why you feel you should not/do not wish to be vaccinated will be considered. The Company does however feel it has an overarching responsibility to reduce any risk of illness for its Service Users and to provide as safe a working environment as possible for its employees, and therefore reserves the right to terminate your employment if you fail to comply.
