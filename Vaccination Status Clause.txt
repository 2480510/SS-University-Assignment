As discussed during the recruitment process, we consider that it is the professional responsibility of all of our staff to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to safeguard both our employees and Service Users, unless they are medically exempt.  It is also a requirement of your employment contract that you have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, which means that you have received all vaccinations recommended by the government, unless you are medically exempt.    Ideally you should be fully vaccinated before commencing employment, or at the very least, you should have a minimum of your first vaccine by your start date of employment (unless exemptions apply), with your second vaccine taking place within 10 weeks of your first and your booster as soon as this is permitted thereafter.   This may include the need for repeat vaccinations as recommended by the UK Government. Any failure to comply with this requirement will be fully investigated and any reasons given as to why you feel you should not/do not wish to be vaccinated will be considered. The Company does however feel that it has an overarching responsibility to reduce any risk of illness for its Service Users and to provide as safe a working environment as possible for its employees, and therefore reserves the right to terminate your employment if you fail to comply.
